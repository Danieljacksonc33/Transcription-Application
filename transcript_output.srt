1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,399
The Bible says in John 14,1,

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,700
Let not your heart be troubled.

3
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,200
You believe in God, believe also in me.

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,000
Can I take a moment and speak heart to heart with you?

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,099
Some days the weight we carry doesn't come from the outside,

6
00:00:13,099 --> 00:00:14,500
it comes from within.

7
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,199
It's not the kind of tired that sleep can fix,

8
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,900
it's that soul deep kind of exhaustion,

9
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:23,199
the kind that lingers even after the world quiets down.

10
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,300
You might show up to work, talk to friends, smile in public,

11
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,400
but on the inside you're barely holding it together.

12
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,899
I remember walking through a season like that

13
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:34,799
when my dad was very sick.

14
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:37,500
Every treatment failed, nothing worked.

15
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,600
And instead of praying I just sobbed.

16
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,600
I couldn't stop.

17
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,000
I didn't know how to.

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,799
I sat in that hospital room barely breathing from the grief.

19
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:50,700
I thought if I cried hard enough,

20
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,400
maybe things would change,

21
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,900
but nothing changed until a friend showed up.

22
00:00:55,899 --> 00:00:58,799
He didn't try to explain the pain away.

23
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:02,399
She just took my hand and quietly said,

24
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,200
have you prayed?

25
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,700
I hadn't.

26
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,599
I didn't feel like I could.

27
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:09,900
But that night through the tears I did,

28
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,599
I didn't pray for a miracle.

29
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:14,700
I just prayed to feel God again.

30
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,500
And even though my dad didn't survive that prayer,

31
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,500
it still worked.

32
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:24,099
It didn't save his body, but it saved my spirit.

33
00:01:24,099 --> 00:01:26,599
It carried me through the kind of darkness

34
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:29,199
you don't talk about out loud.

35
00:01:29,199 --> 00:01:31,699
That night changed me.

36
00:01:31,699 --> 00:01:34,899
And I want you to know if all you can do right now is cry,

37
00:01:34,899 --> 00:01:35,899
that's okay.

38
00:01:35,899 --> 00:01:37,299
But don't stop there.

39
00:01:37,299 --> 00:01:39,599
Let your cry turn into prayer.

40
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,299
Because even when nothing changes around you,

41
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:45,000
prayer changes something inside you.

42
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,099
Maybe you've been there recently

43
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:49,899
or maybe you're there right now.

44
00:01:49,899 --> 00:01:52,099
And if so, I want you to know,

45
00:01:52,099 --> 00:01:54,000
you're not the only one.

46
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,700
You're not weak.

47
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,400
You're human.

48
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,000
And what you're feeling,

49
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,099
it matters to God.

50
00:02:01,099 --> 00:02:04,799
There are moments in life when the pain screams,

51
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,400
when you lose someone,

52
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,300
when someone walks out, when the door slams shut,

53
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,400
and you didn't even see it coming.

54
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,099
Those are the wounds people see.

55
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:16,400
But then there are the quieter ones,

56
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,900
the slow ache of loneliness,

57
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,599
the silent shame you carry from a mistake you made years ago,

58
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:26,099
the anxiety that follows you into the night.

59
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:27,799
And right in the middle of all that,

60
00:02:27,799 --> 00:02:30,299
right there in the mess and the silence,

61
00:02:30,299 --> 00:02:33,299
there's a gentle voice calling your name.

62
00:02:33,299 --> 00:02:35,400
It's not the voice of condemnation.

63
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,500
It's not guilt.

64
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,900
It's Jesus.

65
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,099
Before we go any further,

66
00:02:39,099 --> 00:02:42,299
I want to pause and gently ask you

67
00:02:42,299 --> 00:02:44,900
to subscribe to the Bible Search channel.

68
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,900
Here, we speak truth in love.

69
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:52,400
We talk about the things people are afraid to say out loud

70
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,500
and we remind each other that no matter what life throws at us,

71
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,599
God's Word still stands.

72
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,900
So why does this message from Jesus matter so much?

73
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,200
Because he didn't offer us just a roadmap.

74
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,599
He said, I am the way, not I'll show you the way,

75
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:10,500
not you'll find the truth somewhere out there.

76
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,500
He looked us straight in the eye, spirit to spirit,

77
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,099
and said, it's me.

78
00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:18,400
That means when life gets confusing,

79
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,400
when you've tried the self-help books,

80
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:24,300
the podcasts, the temporary numbing and still feel stuck,

81
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,599
he's the way forward.

82
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,200
He's the way into rest.

83
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,000
He's the way into healing.

84
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,400
He's the way into something that finally makes sense.

85
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,400
Coming to the Father isn't about checking off a religious list.

86
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,599
It's about finally saying, God, I need you.

87
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:40,900
I don't just want to know about you.

88
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,700
I want to know you.

89
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,300
But here's the hard truth that most of us wrestle with.

90
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,599
None of us can get there by our own effort.

91
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:48,700
We've all blown it.

92
00:03:48,699 --> 00:03:50,899
We've all said the wrong thing, thought the wrong thing,

93
00:03:50,899 --> 00:03:52,099
done the wrong thing.

94
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:53,299
We've all got scars.

95
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:54,599
I do too.

96
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:58,000
And that's why Jesus stepped in, not to hand us a rule book,

97
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,199
but to carry us when we're too broken to move forward.

98
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,899
If you're ready to experience that kind of love,

99
00:04:03,899 --> 00:04:09,899
that kind of hope, it starts with a quiet moment of surrender.

100
00:04:09,899 --> 00:04:11,000
It's not fancy.

101
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It's not loud.

102
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,599
It's something like this.

103
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,799
Jesus, I know I've messed up.

104
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:18,300
I've tried to do it all my way and I'm tired.

105
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,000
I believe you're the son of God.

106
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,600
I believe you died for me.

107
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,500
I believe you rose again.

108
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,600
And I believe you are the only way home.

109
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,600
That's not religion.

110
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,500
That's rescue.

111
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,199
That's relationship.

112
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:33,000
And right there, in that moment of surrender,

113
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,300
is where freedom begins.

114
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,199
When you really give him your heart,

115
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,100
you stop walking like someone defeated.

116
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:43,400
You start living like someone who's been set free.

117
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,900
So stay with me.

118
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,399
Because in the next few moments, we're going deeper.

119
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:55,000
You're going to discover how to rebuild your faith from the inside out.

120
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,599
And what we talk about next might be exactly what your heart's been waiting to hear.

121
00:05:01,599 --> 00:05:04,399
If you're with me so far, I want you to type,

122
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:06,699
Amen, in the comments.

123
00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:10,099
And if God is placing anything on your heart right now,

124
00:05:10,099 --> 00:05:11,500
drop it below.

125
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,399
You never know who needs to read it.
