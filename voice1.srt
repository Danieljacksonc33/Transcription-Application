00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,399
The Bible says in John 141,

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,639
Let not your heart be troubled.

3
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:07,120
You believe in God, believe also in me.

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,919
Can I take a moment and speak heart to heart with you?

5
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:13,040
Some days the weight we carry doesn't come from the outside.

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,400
It comes from within.

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,120
It's not the kind of tired that sleep can fix.

8
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,839
It's that sole, deep kind of exhaustion.

9
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:23,120
The kind that lingers even after the world quits down.

10
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:27,199
You might show up to work, talk to friends, smile in public.

11
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:30,239
But on the inside, you're barely holding it together.

12
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:34,719
I remember walking through a season like that when my dad was very sick.

13
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,359
Every treatment failed, nothing worked.

14
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:40,399
And instead of praying, I just sobbed.

15
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,560
I couldn't stop. I didn't know how to.

16
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,600
I sat in that hospital room, barely breathing from the grief.

17
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,239
I thought if I cried hard enough, maybe things would change,

18
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,039
but nothing changed until a friend showed up.

19
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:57,759
He didn't try to explain the pain away.

20
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,359
She just took my hand and quietly said,

21
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,640
have you prayed? I hadn't.

22
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,799
I didn't feel like I could.

23
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,760
But that night, through the tears I did,

24
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,519
I didn't pray for a miracle.

25
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:13,680
I just prayed to feel God again.

26
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,359
And even though my dad didn't survive, that prayer, it still worked.

27
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:23,039
It didn't save his body, but it saved my spirit.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,160
It carried me through the kind of darkness you don't talk about out loud.

29
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,800
That night changed me.

30
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,760
And I want you to know if all you can do right now is cry, that's okay.

31
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:39,520
But don't stop there. Let your cry turn into prayer.

32
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,240
Because even when nothing changes around you,

33
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,880
prayer changes something inside you.

34
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,800
Maybe you've been there recently, or maybe you're there right now.

35
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,959
And if so, I want you to know you're not the only one.

36
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,640
You're not weak.

37
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:56,239
You're human.

38
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,920
And what you're feeling, it matters to God.

39
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:03,920
There are moments in life when the pain screams,

40
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,239
when you lose someone.

41
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:09,199
When someone walks out, when the door slams shut,

42
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,960
and you didn't even see it coming, those are the wounds people see.

43
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,240
But then there are the quieter ones, the slow ache of loneliness.

44
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,480
The silent shame you carry from a mistake you made years ago,

45
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,800
the anxiety that follows you into the night.

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,160
And right in the middle of all that, right there in the mess and the silence,

47
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,160
there's a gentle voice calling your name.

48
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,120
It's not the voice of condemnation, it's not guilt, it's Jesus.

49
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,160
Before we go any further, I want to pause and gently ask you

50
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,320
to subscribe to the Bible Search channel.

51
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,200
Here we speak truth in love.

52
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:52,239
We talk about the things people are afraid to say out loud,

53
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:57,439
and we remind each other that no matter what life throws at us, God's word still stands.

54
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:00,799
So why does this message from Jesus matter so much?

55
00:03:00,799 --> 00:03:03,119
Because he didn't offer us just a road map.

56
00:03:03,119 --> 00:03:06,479
He said, I am the way, not I'll show you the way,

57
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:08,719
not you'll find the truth somewhere out there.

58
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:14,879
He looked us straight in the eye, spirit to spirit, and said, it's me.

59
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,240
That means when life gets confusing, when you've tried the self-help books,

60
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:25,439
the podcasts, the temporary numbing, and still feel stuck, he's the way forward,

61
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:31,840
he's the way into rest, he's the way into healing, he's the way into something that finally

62
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,240
makes sense. Coming to the Father isn't about checking off a religious list,

63
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:41,680
it's about finally saying, God, I need you, I don't just want to know about you, I want to know you.

64
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,439
But here's the hard truth that most of us wrestle with, none of us can get there by our own effort.

65
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:51,920
We've all blown it, we've all said the wrong thing, thought the wrong thing, done the wrong thing,

66
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:57,760
we've all got scars, I do too, and that's why Jesus stepped in, not to hand us a rule book,

67
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,040
but to carry us when we're too broken to move forward.

68
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,800
If you're ready to experience that kind of love, that kind of hope,

69
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,960
it starts with a quiet moment of surrender.

70
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,879
It's not fancy, it's not loud, it's something like this.

71
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:18,160
Jesus, I know I've messed up, I've tried to do it all my way, and I'm tired,

72
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:23,360
I believe you're the Son of God, I believe you died for me, I believe you rose again,

73
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,360
and I believe you are the only way home.

74
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:32,879
That's not religion, that's rescue, that's relationship, and right there, in that moment of surrender,

75
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:38,720
is where freedom begins. When you really give him your heart, you stop walking like someone

76
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:44,800
defeated, you start living like someone who's been set free. So stay with me,

77
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:51,920
because in the next few moments we're going deeper, you're going to discover how to rebuild your

78
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:59,600
faith from the inside out, and what we talk about next might be exactly what your heart's been

79
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:05,840
waiting to hear. If you're with me so far, I want you to type our men in the comments,

80
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:13,439
and if God is placing anything on your heart right now, drop it below. You never know who needs to read it.
